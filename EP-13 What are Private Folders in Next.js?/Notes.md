### ✅ **Interview Questions on Private Folders in Next.js (App Router)**

---

#### 1. **What is a private folder in Next.js?**

**Answer:**
A private folder is a folder whose name starts with an **underscore (`_`)**, and Next.js **does not treat it as a route**. It’s useful for storing code like components without generating pages.

---

#### 2. **Why would you use a private folder in Next.js?**

**Answer:**
We use private folders when we want to **store components or utility files inside the `app` directory** but **don’t want them to become pages/routes**.

---

#### 3. **What happens if we create a folder inside `app` and add a `page.js` file inside it?**

**Answer:**
Next.js will treat that folder as a **route**, and the `page.js` will become a **page** accessible by its folder name in the URL.

---

#### 4. **How do you prevent a folder from becoming a route in Next.js?**

**Answer:**
Rename the folder with an underscore prefix (e.g., `_components`). Next.js will **ignore it during routing**.

---

#### 5. **Can you access a private folder by entering the URL manually?**

**Answer:**
No, private folders are not routable by default. If you try to access them in the browser, you'll see a **404 Not Found** page.

---

#### 6. **Is there any way to access a private folder route manually?**

**Answer:**
Yes. You can use `%5f` (URL-encoded form of underscore) in the URL to access it.
For example, `/components` becomes `/%5fcomponents`.

---

#### 7. **If we move the components folder outside the `app` directory, what happens?**

**Answer:**
It becomes **completely ignored by routing**, and can still be imported and used in components — this is also a recommended convention.

---

#### 8. **What is the impact of having a `page.js` inside a non-private folder?**

**Answer:**
It creates a **new route** based on the folder name, and that component will be rendered when the route is visited.

---

#### 9. **What is the benefit of keeping the `components` folder outside the `app` folder in Next.js?**

**Answer:**
It avoids accidentally creating routes and keeps the `app` directory clean and focused only on routing.

---

#### 10. **Is it mandatory to use underscore to make a folder private in Next.js?**

**Answer:**
No, it’s only needed **if the folder is inside the `app` directory** and you don’t want it to become a route. Otherwise, you can keep such folders outside the `app`.
