### âœ… Basic Interview Questions on Route Groups in Next.js

---

**1. What are Route Groups in Next.js?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
Route Groups in Next.js allow you to organize your application routes into folders for logical grouping **without changing the URL structure**.

---

**2. Why do we use Route Groups in Next.js?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
To keep the folder structure clean and organized, especially for large projects, by grouping related pages together logicallyâ€”like `marketing`, `auth`, or `application`â€”while keeping URLs like `/about` or `/services` unchanged.

---

**3. How do you create a route group in the `app` directory of Next.js?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
You wrap the folder name with **parentheses**. For example:

```
(app)/(marketing)/about/page.tsx
```

This way, `/about` will still work even though it's inside the `(marketing)` folder.

---

**4. Does using a route group change the URL path in Next.js?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
No. The folder name inside parentheses is ignored in the URL.
For example:

* File: `(marketing)/about/page.tsx`
* URL: `/about` âœ…

---

**5. What problem do Route Groups solve?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
Without route groups, moving pages like `/about` into a folder (e.g., `marketing/about`) would change the URL to `/marketing/about`. Route groups help **organize files** without changing the public-facing URLs.

---

**6. How do route groups help with layout management?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
You can assign different layouts to different groups. For example, `marketing` pages can have a different header/footer from `application` pages by placing separate `layout.tsx` files inside each group.

---

**7. What happens if you donâ€™t use parentheses in the folder name?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
The folder becomes part of the route.
E.g., `marketing/about/page.tsx` â†’ URL becomes `/marketing/about`

---

**8. Can you assign custom layouts to different route groups?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
Yes. Each route group can have its own `layout.tsx` file with different headers, footers, or styling.

---

**9. Whatâ€™s an example use case of route groups?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**

* Grouping `/about` and `/services` under `(marketing)`
* Grouping `/login`, `/register`, and `/forgot-password` under `(auth)`
  All while keeping URLs clean like `/login`, `/about`, etc.

---

**10. Does the `not-found` page inherit layout from route groups?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
Yes. If the `not-found.tsx` is placed inside a route group, it inherits that group's layout unless overridden.

---

**11. How can you exclude header/footer from the `not-found` page?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
Place `not-found.tsx` in a route group or root where no layout is defined, or conditionally render layout elements using custom logic.

---

**12. What file/folder structure helps manage layouts better in large Next.js apps?**
ðŸ‘‰ **Answer:**
Use multiple route groups like:

```
(app)
â”œâ”€â”€ (marketing)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ (application)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx
â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx (optional global fallback)
```
