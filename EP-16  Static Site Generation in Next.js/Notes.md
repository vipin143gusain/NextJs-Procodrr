Here are **interview-style questions and simple answers** based on the transcript you provided, focusing on **Static Site Generation (SSG)** in **Next.js**:

---

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Understanding

**1. What is Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js?**
**Answer:**
SSG is a form of server-side rendering where HTML pages are generated at **build time** and served as static files.

---

**2. Is SSG a part of server-side rendering?**
**Answer:**
Yes, SSG is a type of server-side rendering because the rendering happens on the server, but specifically **at build time**.

---

**3. When is SSG useful?**
**Answer:**
SSG is ideal for **frequently visited pages** or content that **doesn't change often**, like blogs, documentation, or marketing pages.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Next.js Implementation

**4. Which function is used for SSG in dynamic routes in Next.js?**
**Answer:**
`generateStaticParams()` â€“ It tells Next.js which dynamic routes should be pre-rendered at build time.

---

**5. What should `generateStaticParams()` return?**
**Answer:**
It should return an array of objects, where each object has parameters required for the dynamic route.
Example:

```js
return [{ blogid: "1" }, { blogid: "2" }]
```

---

**6. Can we hardcode values in `generateStaticParams()`?**
**Answer:**
Yes, we can hardcode them like `[{ blogid: '1' }, { blogid: '2' }]`, but in real projects, we usually fetch them from an API.

---

**7. Can `generateStaticParams()` call an external API?**
**Answer:**
Yes. It can be an `async` function where we fetch data using `fetch()` and return the mapped result.

---

**8. What happens if the dynamic route is not included in `generateStaticParams()`?**
**Answer:**
Next.js will fall back to **dynamic rendering** at request time for that specific route.

---

**9. What build command is used to generate static pages in Next.js?**
**Answer:**
`npm run build`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Performance & Debugging

**10. How does SSG improve performance?**
**Answer:**
Pages are pre-built, so thereâ€™s no need to render them at request time. They load faster and reduce server load.

---

**11. How can you confirm if a page is statically generated?**
**Answer:**
In the build output, statically generated pages are shown with a **solid white circle**, while dynamically rendered pages show an **F** icon.

---

**12. What happens if the IDs returned are not strings?**
**Answer:**
Next.js will throw an error. The IDs must be strings. You can convert using `.toString()`.

---

**13. Where are the generated static files stored?**
**Answer:**
In the `.next` folder, under the serverâ€™s build files.

---

**14. What is the `First Load JS` size shown in the build output?**
**Answer:**
Itâ€™s the total size of JavaScript files needed to load the page initially, including all chunks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Real-world Scenarios

**15. When should you avoid using SSG?**
**Answer:**
When your page content changes **frequently or in real-time**, SSG is not ideal. Use **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** or **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** instead.

---

**16. Can we generate thousands of pages using `generateStaticParams()`?**
**Answer:**
Yes, but it will increase build time. For huge numbers of pages, **ISR** is recommended.

---

**17. What is the fallback behavior if a route is not pre-rendered in SSG?**
**Answer:**
If not handled, it will return a 404. If fallback is enabled (in older versions), Next.js can render it on-demand.
