### ðŸ§ª **Interview Questions from Layout.js Transcript**

---

#### 1. **Q: What is the purpose of `layout.js` in Next.js App Router?**

**A:** It provides a common layout (like header and footer) that wraps all pages in a particular directory. It ensures consistent UI elements across multiple pages.

---

#### 2. **Q: Where should the `html` and `body` tags be placed?**

**A:** Only in the **root `layout.js`** file. Inner layouts should not contain `html` or `body` tags to avoid errors like `body cannot be a child of body`.

---

#### 3. **Q: What does `children` represent in layout.js?**

**A:** `children` represents the specific page content that will be rendered inside the layout. Each pageâ€™s component is injected where `children` is placed.

---

#### 4. **Q: What happens if you forget to include `{children}` in a layout?**

**A:** The actual page content will not be rendered, and only the static part of the layout will appear on screen.

---

#### 5. **Q: How do you make a layout specific to a folder like `/services`?**

**A:** By creating a `layout.js` file inside the `/services` folder. This will apply that layout to all pages inside `/services`.

---

#### 6. **Q: Can you add a header and footer inside layout.js?**

**A:** Yes, you can place components like `<Header />` and `<Footer />` inside the layout to display them on all pages.

---

#### 7. **Q: What are the rules for inner layouts (not root layout)?**

**A:** You should:

* **Avoid** using `<html>` and `<body>`
* **Always** include `{children}`
* Use semantic tags like `<section>`, `<main>`, or `<aside>`

---

#### 8. **Q: How does Next.js handle metadata like the `<title>` tag in App Router?**

**A:** Next.js recommends using the **`metadata` object** or the **`generateMetadata()`** function per page instead of hardcoding `<title>` tags inside the layout.

---

#### 9. **Q: What issue was faced when page content wasnâ€™t visible, and how was it fixed?**

**A:** It was likely a **caching issue**, and the content reappeared after a **Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)**.

---

#### 10. **Q: Why do we create multiple layout.js files for different folders?**

**A:** To apply **folder-level customization**. For example, adding a sidebar only for `/services` pages.

---

#### 11. **Q: Can layouts be nested in Next.js?**

**A:** Yes. Next.js supports **nested layouts** â€” each folder can have its own `layout.js` that wraps pages in that folder.

---

#### 12. **Q: What happens if we render a layout without exporting it properly?**

**A:** You'll see an error like `"export is not a React component"`. You must `export default` the component properly.

---

#### 13. **Q: What semantic tags are preferred inside layout.js?**

**A:** Tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` are recommended instead of `<div>` or structural tags like `<html>` and `<body>` (except root).

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Tips:

* Layouts in App Router improve **code reuse**.
* Always **render `{children}`** to avoid missing page content.
* Use **modular components** (`<Header />`, `<Footer />`) to keep the layout clean and maintainable.
