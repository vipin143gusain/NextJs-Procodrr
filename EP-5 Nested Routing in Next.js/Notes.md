Here’s a set of **interview-style questions** (with **simple and concise answers**) based on the transcript about **Nested Routing in Next.js**:

---

### ✅ **Basic Understanding**

**1. What is nested routing in Next.js?**
➡️ Nested routing means creating routes inside routes, like `/services/web-dev` or `/services/seo`. In Next.js, we achieve it by creating subfolders inside the `app` or `pages` directory.

---

### ✅ **Scenario-Based**

**2. Can you give an example of when to use nested routing?**
➡️ If a site has a `/services` page showing all services, and we want `/services/web-dev` or `/services/seo` to show specific service details, we use nested routing.

---

**3. How do you create a nested route for `web-dev` under `services`?**
➡️ Inside the `app/services` folder, create a `web-dev` folder, then add a `page.js` file inside it. This creates the `/services/web-dev` route.

---

**4. What happens if we use capital letters in route folder names?**
➡️ Next.js routing is **case-sensitive**, so `/services/SEO` is different from `/services/seo`.

---

### ✅ **Linking and Navigation**

**5. How do you link to a nested route in Next.js?**
➡️ Use the `Link` component and give the full path like:

```jsx
<Link href="/services/web-dev">Web Development</Link>
```

---

**6. Does Next.js automatically append relative paths like `./web-dev`?**
➡️ No. Unlike `react-router-dom`, Next.js does **not** automatically resolve relative paths, so you must use full paths.

---

### ✅ **Implementation Details**

**7. How do you structure folders for multiple nested service pages?**
➡️ Example:

```
/app
  /services
    /web-dev
      page.js
    /seo
      page.js
```

---

**8. What content should go in `web-dev/page.js`?**
➡️ Any specific content related to Web Development, like:

```jsx
export default function WebDev() {
  return <p>Web Development Services</p>;
}
```

---

### ✅ **Next Steps**

**9. What if we have thousands of service pages like posts?**
➡️ For dynamic pages like posts, we use **dynamic routing** instead of manually creating thousands of files.

---

**10. What is the difference between nested and dynamic routing in Next.js?**
➡️ Nested routing is folder-based (`/services/web-dev`), while dynamic routing uses parameters like `[slug]` for handling many pages (e.g., `/post/[id]`).
